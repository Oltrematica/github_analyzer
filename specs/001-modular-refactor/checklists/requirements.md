# Specification Quality Checklist: Modular Architecture Refactoring

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Content Quality | ✅ Pass | All items verified |
| Requirement Completeness | ✅ Pass | No clarifications needed |
| Feature Readiness | ✅ Pass | Ready for planning |

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`
- All 4 user stories have clear acceptance scenarios
- 19 functional requirements defined with testable criteria
- 7 measurable success criteria established
- 5 edge cases documented with expected behaviors
- Assumptions section clarifies scope boundaries
