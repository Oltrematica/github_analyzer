# Jira Projects Configuration
#
# List Jira project keys to analyze, one per line.
# Lines starting with '#' are comments and will be ignored.
# Empty lines are also ignored.
#
# Example project keys:
# PROJ
# DEV
# OPS
#
# To use this file:
# 1. Copy to jira_projects.txt: cp jira_projects.txt.example jira_projects.txt
# 2. Replace example keys with your actual Jira project keys
# 3. Set the required environment variables:
#    - JIRA_URL: Your Jira instance URL (e.g., https://company.atlassian.net)
#    - JIRA_EMAIL: Your Jira account email
#    - JIRA_API_TOKEN: Your Jira API token
#
# Alternatively, run the analyzer without this file to interactively
# select projects from those available in your Jira instance:
#   python dev_analyzer.py --sources jira
#
# The project keys below are examples - replace them with your own:
# PROJ
# DEV
